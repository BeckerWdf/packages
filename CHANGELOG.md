# Eclipse Packaging Project Change Log

The Eclipse Packaging Project (EPP) assembles the contents of the quarterly Eclipse Simulatanous Release (SimRel) into products that can be downloaded from the [Eclipse IDE website](https://eclipseide.org).
This document aims to highlight configuration and content changes of the packages provided by EPP in each quarterly release.
For changes in Eclipse projects that contribute to SimRel and are included in the EPP packages, refer to the change log or New and Noteworthy document of the particpating projects.
The [Eclipse IDE New & Noteworthy](https://eclipseide.org/release/noteworthy/) page combines all those documents in one place.
